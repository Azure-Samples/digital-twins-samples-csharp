## API
This folder contains helpers that wrap Digital Twins Rest API to produce and consume in memory [models](../models/readme.md).  They also contains some helpers for simplifying interactions.

These apis are not complete.  See the Swagger documentation that is part of your Azure Digital Twins instance for a complete description of capabilities.  Also see [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) for how you can generate full c# models and apis from that documentation.
