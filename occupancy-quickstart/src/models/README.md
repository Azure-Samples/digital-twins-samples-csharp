# Models

This folder contains models used when interacting with Azure Digital Twins Management APIs.

Note that the supplied models demonstrate only a limited number of the total available fields.

## Swagger

See the included Swagger documentation to see all available models and fields:

A Swagger sneak preview is provided to demonstrate the API feature set. It's hosted at [docs.westcentralus.azuresmartspaces.net/management/swagger](https://docs.westcentralus.azuresmartspaces.net/management/swagger).

You can access your own, generated, Management API Swagger documentation at:

```plaintext
https://yourInstanceName.yourLocation.azuresmartspaces.net/management/swagger
```

* Replace `yourInstanceName` with the name of your Azure Digital Twins instance.  
* Replace `yourLocation` with which server region your instance is hosted on.  

## AutoRest

Also see [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) to learn how to generate full C# models from that documentation.
