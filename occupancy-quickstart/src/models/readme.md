## Models

This folder contains models used when interacting with Azure Digital Twins Management APIs.

## Note

These models are not complete (they do not contain all fields available).  

See the Swagger documentation that is part of your Azure Digital Twins instance for a complete description.  

Also see [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) for how you can generate full C# models from that documentation.
