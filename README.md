# Digital Twins Samples

This repo contains .NET Core samples that demonstrate how to use the Azure Digital Twins platform. Each folder contains a separate .NET Core app.  

See the `readme` in each sub-folder for specific details about each app.

## Get Started

1. [Install dotnet core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).
1. Get the code
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples-csharp.git
cd digital-twins-samples-csharp
```

The repo contains several standalone projects:

- The [Occupancy](./occupancy-quickstart/readme.md) sample is suggested as a first example to gain familiarity with Digital Twins.
- The [Device Connectivity](./device-connectivity/readme.md) sample demonstrates how to connect a device to Digital Twins and submit sensory data.

For corresponding documentation, please see the project readme's above.

## Visual Studio Code

A [workspace file](./digital-twins-samples.code-workspace) containing all the apps is included for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) users.

Alternatively, each app can be opened individually.
