## API

This folder contains helpers that wrap Digital Twins REST API to produce and consume in memory [models](../models/readme.md).  They also contains some helpers for simplifying interactions.

> [!NOTE]
> These APIs are not complete.  

See the Swagger documentation that is part of your Azure Digital Twins instance for a complete description of capabilities.  

Also see [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) for how you can generate full C# models and APIs from that documentation.
